## What is Arduino

Arduino is an **open-source electronics platform** for making various interactive projects. It consists of a hardware board and a development environment based on a simplified version of the C/C++ programming language. There is a microcontroller on the Arduino board that reads input signals (such as buttons, light sensors, etc.) and performs corresponding actions based on pre-written code (such as lighting LEDs, driving motors, etc.).

Arduino's features include ease of use, low cost, open source, cross-platform, and more. It is widely used in various projects such as automation control, robotics, sensor applications, art installations, etc.
